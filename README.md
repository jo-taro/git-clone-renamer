# Git clone renamer

* This add-on injects JavaScript into web pages to change git ssh clone url 
  to a appropriate host when the user has two or more accounts for the git
  hosting sites like github, gitlab etc.

## What it does


* it searches git clone url and changes it's host by the options set by user.


## Limitation

* Currently, it supports only `github.com`. this limitation will improve on the
  future versions.
